Originally an economics major now turned into a software engineer, I had a deep passion for decision modelling. My inspiration for it came from movies like Moneyball & A beautiful mind\nI’m originally a Rubyist, I was introduced to Clojure long time ago, but I never got around using it commercially due to how hard it is to find a Clojure job. This year(2024, in case you are reading this in the future) I saw a talk @ London Clojurians by the Scicloj which showcased a new stack for DS/ML. The stack includes:\nThis humble Quarto journal you see is a wee attempt at documenting my steps towards achieving prowess at modern, applied ML/DS.\nJoin me on my silly explorations",

Just invoke tc/dataset over a URL or filename and you’ll immediately get a primitive in which is very easy to operate on.\nIn this example I just select a few columns and keep the top 10.\nI also added a function to-kebab-case which casts the datasets keys in this-format\ntablecloth documentation\nOrdering is very easy too\nI now know that I want to re-use data/nasdaq-instrument-list.csv so I’ll extract it onto it’s own expression via def.\nVisualising information is very easy too. Because the US holds the vast majority of entries, I am applying a logarithmic scale to keep the sizes of the bars consistent, albeit the values are pretty skewed towards a few entries.",

    "text": "2.3 Closing remarks\nI initially thought this would be a how-to piece but it evolved into being more of a “stack review”. My only points of comparison are to use Snowflake + SQL to plot, slice & dice. Or a more widely adopted solution like Jupyter, Numpy & others.\nI find this stack to be oddly entising, it’s just so simple and highly declarative, there’s python interop and lazily evaluated collections may mean its a lot less code to write than if I were using Numpy. Time will only tell\nIt would be nice to see tc/dataset being able to take in an SQL connection and manage long running queries elegantly straight from the text editor.\nI’ll be posting more in the coming days, stay tuned.\n\nsource: src/cashcloj/core.clj",
