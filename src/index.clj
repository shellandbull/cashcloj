 "# Welcome to Cashcloj,

My name is Mario Gintili. You can find me on Github [@shellandbull](https://github.com/shellandbull).

Data Science, Data Engineering & Machine Learning have always been a personal interest of mine. During my uni years I was an economics major and I had a deep passion for decision modelling alla [Moneyball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moneyball_(film)). My inspiration came from films of the sort

I'm originally a Rubyist and I was introduced to Clojure long time ago. This year(2024, in case you are reading this in the future) I saw a talk @ [London Clojurians](https://londonclojurians.org/) by the [Scicloj](https://scicloj.github.io/) which showcased a new stack for DS/ML. The stack includes:

- Using [spacemacs](https://www.spacemacs.org/), a flavour of emacs, for code editing
- [Interactive programming](https://docs.cider.mx/cider/usage/interactive_programming.html) practises
- [Tablecloth](https://scicloj.github.io/tablecloth/) & [Clay](https://github.com/scicloj/clay) for dataset manipulation & visualisation
- [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) for technical publishing

This site is a documents my journey learning the ML/DS chops

Join me on my silly explorations

## Goals

- Learn to use emacs in evil mode
- Learn data engineering. The usual stuff like feature engineering, scrubbing data, joining datasets, formulating the right questions
- Learn Clojure. My background's in OOP dynamically typed languages, this is my first lisp 
- Learn Scicloj
