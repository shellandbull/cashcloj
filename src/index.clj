 "# Welcome to Cashcloj

Find me on Github [@shellandbull](https://github.com/shellandbull) & on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mario-gintili-software-engineer/)

Machine learning & data science have always been an interest of mine. Originally an economics major now turned into a software engineer, I had a deep passion for decision modelling. My inspiration for it came from movies like [Moneyball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moneyball_(film)) & [A beautiful mind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Beautiful_Mind_(film))

I'm originally a Rubyist, I was introduced to Clojure long time ago, but I never got around using it commercially due to how hard it is to find a Clojure job. This year(2024, in case you are reading this in the future) I saw a talk @ [London Clojurians](https://londonclojurians.org/) by the [Scicloj](https://scicloj.github.io/) which showcased a new stack for DS/ML. The stack includes:

- [Spacemacs](https://www.spacemacs.org/), a flavour of emacs, for code editing
- [Interactive programming](https://docs.cider.mx/cider/usage/interactive_programming.html) practises
- [Tablecloth](https://scicloj.github.io/tablecloth/) & [Clay](https://github.com/scicloj/clay) for dataset manipulation & visualisation
- [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) for technical publishing

This humble Quarto journal you see is a wee attempt at documenting my steps towards achieving prowess at modern, applied ML/DS.

Join me on my silly explorations

## Goals

- Learn emacs in evil mode
- Learn data engineering
- Learn machine learning
- Learn Clojure
- Use the Scicloj stack to achieve all of the above
